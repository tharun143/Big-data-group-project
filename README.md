- **Continuous Improvement:**
   - *Feedback Sessions:* Regular feedback sessions will be conducted to evaluate team dynamics and identify areas for improvement.
   - *Adaptation:* Team rules may be adapted based on feedback and changing project requirements.

- **Communication Response Timeline:** Same day

- **Version Control:** Our approach involves preserving the work within the Git repository. Team members are expected to submit their work by initiating pull requests, with the remaining members responsible for conducting thorough reviews.

## Capstone and Final Video/PPT Completion Plan:

As the capstone project needs to be completed individually with the help of a group, we are planning to interact with each other once in a week and discuss on the way to approach. If we are stuck anytime with queries we are going to discuss and resolve as a team sharing the various ideas. All of the team members must complete the capstone by Dec 5, 2023(Due by :Dec 5, 2023) .

We are planning to complete the final video/PPT by Dec 9 2023(Due by :Dec 9, 2023).

## Selection of Data and Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge:

### Selected Data Set - The Sea Around Us

- The dataset from the Sea Around Us website provides extensive historical information about fisheries globally, specifically focusing on yearly fishery catches from 1950 to 2018.
  - The data includes information about:
    - Which countries caught which types of fish in open seas areas and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs).
    - Details on the quantity of fish caught.
    - The value of the catch in 2010 US dollars.
- Three specific data files will be used for the capstone project:
  - One containing data from all open seas areas.
  - Another from a single open seas area in the Pacific ocean (Pacific, Western Central).
  - The third from the EEZ of a single country (Fiji) near the Pacific, Western Central open seas area.
- This selection allows for a diverse set of scenarios to test the infrastructure's capability to handle different data types and scales.

### Business Problem or Opportunity:

- The main business problem is to analyze the fishing impact in open seas areas, focusing on sustainability, resource management, and potential environmental impacts.

- Opportunities include identifying trends in fishery catches over the years, understanding the distribution of catches across different countries, and assessing the economic value of these catches. Additionally, the infrastructure can support broader research and policy decisions related to fisheries.

### Domain Knowledge

Understanding the concepts of open seas and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) is crucial for analyzing the dataset effectively. Open seas refer to areas of the ocean at least 200 nautical miles away from any single country's shoreline, where resources, including fish, are generally considered not belonging to any one country. On the other hand, EEZs are areas within 200 nautical miles of a country's shoreline, where the country typically claims exclusive access to resources, including fish.

The infrastructure to be built in AWS would be capable of handling below specific data files:

- Data from all open seas areas: This file provides a global overview of fishing activities in open seas, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the impact of fishing on a worldwide scale.

- Data from a single open seas area in the Pacific ocean (Pacific, Western Central): Focusing on a specific region near Fiji and other countries allows for a more detailed analysis of fishing impact in that particular area, providing insights into regional variations.

- Data from the EEZ of a single country (Fiji): Analyzing data from the Exclusive Economic Zone of Fiji allows for understanding the local impact of fishing activities and the relationship between a country's EEZ and nearby open seas areas.

- Familiarity with the data, including columns such as country, fish type, catch quantity, and catch value, is essential for meaningful analysis.

### Research Objectives and Question(s):

- Objective: Develop an AWS infrastructure capable of hosting and processing extensive historical fisheries data from open seas areas globally (1950-2018).

- Question to be addressed: With respect to the dataset encompassing all open sea regions, what are the worldwide patterns in annual fisheries captures from 1950 to 2018?


- Objective: Establish a specialized infrastructure element using AWS that will analyze the effects of fishing in the Western Central and Pacific high seas and offer illustrative insights into regional differences.

- Question to be addressed: How does the fishing impact in the Pacific, Western Central open seas area differ from the global trends, considering the specific dataset for this region?


- Objective: Develop a visual analysis model of the fishing impact in Fiji's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) , with an emphasis on local fishing operations and the resulting effects on the environment and economy.

- Question to be addressed: What understanding of local fishing practices and their effects may be obtained by examining data from Fiji's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)? 

- Objective: Establish a comprehensive reporting system that extracts valuable insights, trends, and correlations from the fishing data, aiding data analysts in generating informative reports.

- Question to be addressed: Taking into account the dataset from all open ocean areas, are there any relationships between the amount, kinds, and economic worth of fish caught?

- Objective: Assess the economic value of fishery catches, measured in 2010 US dollars.

- Question to be addressed: How does the economic value of fishery catches vary globally, and are there correlations between economic trends and fishery practices in different regions?

- Objective: Develop metrics for assessing the sustainability of global fisheries.

- Question to be addressed: What indicators within the dataset can be used to evaluate the sustainability of fishery practices, considering factors like overfishing and changes in species composition?

- Objective: Compare the efficiency of fishery operations in open seas areas and Exclusive Economic Zones.

- Question to be addressed: Are there notable differences in the efficiency of fishery catches between open seas and EEZs, and what factors contribute to these disparities?

- Objective: Examine the role of human activities in shaping global fisheries trends.

- Question to be addressed: To what extent have human activities, such as industrialization and policy decisions, impacted the patterns and sustainability of global fisheries?
